## Objective
Learn to implement dynamic routing for a product details page in a React application. Create a product listing where each product links to a unique detail page based on the product ID, using data from a JSON file.

## Setup

1. **Create an 'Exercises' Directory** (If not already done):
   - If you haven't already, create a main directory on your local machine to house all your exercises. You can do this using `mkdir Exercises`.

2. **Fork the Repository**:
   - Navigate to the GitHub repository for this exercise at `03-23-dynamic-product-details`.
   - Click on the 'Fork' button to create a fork of the repository.

3. **Clone Your Forked Repository**:
   - Open your terminal.
   - Navigate to your `Exercises` directory using `cd path/to/Exercises`.
   - Run `git clone <your-forked-repo-url>` to clone the repository to your machine.
   - This will create a new directory named `03-23-dynamic-product-details` under `Exercises`.

4. **Initial Setup**:
   - The repository already includes the skeleton code generated by Create React App, along with a `data` folder in the `src` directory containing the `products.json` file.
   - Navigate to the exercise directory: `cd 03-23-dynamic-product-details`.
   - Run `npm install` to install the necessary dependencies.
   - Start the development server with `npm start`.

## `products.json` Structure
The `products.json` file in the `data` folder will have the following structure:

```json
{
  "products": {
    "1": {
      "name": "Product One",
      "description": "Description for Product One",
      "price": "19.99"
    },
    "2": {
      "name": "Product Two",
      "description": "Description for Product Two",
      "price": "29.99"
    },
    // ... more products
  }
}
```

Each product is an object with properties like `name`, `description`, and `price`, keyed by `productId`.

## Exercise Instructions

1. **Create a Product Listing Page**:
   - Build a `ProductList` component that displays a list of products. Use the `products.json` file as the source of product data.
   - Display each product's name in the list, and each product name should be a link to its detailed page.

2. **Implement Dynamic Routes for Product Details**:
   - Set up dynamic routes in your application so that clicking a product name in the `ProductList` navigates to the corresponding `ProductDetail` page.
   - The route for each product detail page should be `/product/:productId`.
   - Create a `ProductDetail` component that retrieves and displays the details of the product from `products.json` based on the `productId` obtained from the URL.

3. **Hint for Accessing Product Details**:
   - In the `ProductDetail` component, use the `useParams` hook from `react-router-dom` to extract the `productId` from the URL.
   - Use this `productId` to access the corresponding product's details from the `products.json` file.

## Testing the Dynamic Product Details Page
- Ensure that clicking on a product in the `ProductList` navigates to the `ProductDetail` page.
- Verify that the `ProductDetail` page correctly displays the information for the product based on the `productId` in the URL.

## Submission

1. **Commit Your Changes**:
   - After completing the exercise, ensure all your changes are saved.
   - Run `git add .` to stage your changes.
   - Run  to commit your changes.`git commit -m "Completed Dynamic Product Details Page exercise"`

2. **Push to Your Fork**:
   - Run `git push` to push your commits to your forked repository on GitHub.

3. **Create a Pull Request**:
   - Go to your forked repository on GitHub.
   - Click on 'Pull Request' to create a new pull request to the original repository.
   - Ensure the pull request details are filled out, explaining the changes you made.
